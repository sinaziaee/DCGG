# DCGG

DCGG is a novel approach towards drug combination prediction utilizing graph neural networks and graph auto encoders. The approach comprises of 6 different models and 7 different graphs. The graphs are augmented with differenet node features including drug indicatinos, drug side-effects, and node2vec drug features extracted from drug-drug-interaction network.
